# Project Title

An Interactive Dashboard was made for the visualization of network protocols.

## Description

The project was made for a 24-hour hackathon at Cisco, Bengaluru. This project helps visualize Cisco Trust Sec software, which displays network protocols and control.
It is the next app based on the express server. It uses MongoDB Atlas as its database.

## Getting Started

### Installing

```
cd frontend && npm install
```
```
cd backend && npm install
```

This installs dependencies for both the backend and frontend.

This application uses a MongoDB Atlas Cluster as a Database. Hence, a URI needs to be generated for that.
Generate the URI by creating an account.

MONGO_URI can be generated and stored in a .env file in the backend folder

### Executing

For Frontend
```
npm run build
npm run start
```

For Backend
```
npm run start
```
